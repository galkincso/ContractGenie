## Contract making web application
Rapid advances in technology have transformed our everyday lives, allowing us to do our jobs more efficiently and save time with automated solutions. At the same time, it is important that technological advances do not come at the expense of sustainability. Using modern tools and technologies may seem simple and easy at first glance, but in many cases, they also require attention, skill and expertise. This is no different, for example, when it comes to contract drafting.

Traditional contracts require several steps: finding the right template, filling in the details accurately, carefully drafting the content and avoiding legal loopholes. These processes are time-consuming and error-prone, which can be particularly problematic for individuals or the elderly.

In my thesis I present the design and development of a browser-based web application that supports contract drafting using artificial intelligence. A number of contract templates are available in the application, but it is also possible to upload custom templates. The system guides the user through the entire contract creation process, ensuring data accuracy and content formality.

I ensure the accuracy of the data by using OCR technology, as it eliminates the risk of misspelling personal data extracted from documents using character recognition and speeds up and simplifies the process. I use large language models and Question Answering technologies to personalize and transform the content of the contract.

I have also integrated the use of digital signatures into the system for sustainability, reducing the need for paper-based processes. The application is fully responsive, so it can be accessed on any device and by any age group thanks to its user- friendly interface.
The aim of my thesis is to demonstrate the potential of AI-enabled contract creation and to provide a solution that makes the process simpler, faster and more environmentally friendly for users.
